 * You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer
 * amount representing a total amount of money. Return the number of combinations that make up that
 * amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return 0.
 * You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin. The answer is guaranteed
 * to fit into a signed 32-bit integer.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * 1 <= coins.length <= 300
 * 1 <= coins[i] <= 5000
 * All values of coins are unique
 * 0 <= amount <= 5000
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: amount = 5, coins = [1, 2, 5]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:
 * 5=5, 5=2+2+1, 5=2+1+1+1, 5=1+1+1+1+1
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: amount = 3, coins = [2]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: amount = 10, coins = [10]
 * Output: 1
 *
 * Approach: Unbounded knapsack DP — dp[i] holds the number of combinations that sum to i. Iterating
 * coins in the outer loop and amounts in the inner loop ensures each combination is counted once
 * (order-independent), avoiding the permutation overcounting that occurs with the reversed loop order.
